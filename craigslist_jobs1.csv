Stop What You're Doing. It's Not Working. Start Selling $2 Car Leads!!,,compensation:,contract,,2025-04-15T15:14:23-0400,"You’ve probably seen this ad before. Why? Because it works. So, what are you waiting for? We host informative Q&A sessions on Zoom every Monday and Thursday at 9 AM (PST). This is your chance to see exactly how this works, ask questions, hear from past trainees, and decide if it's right for you. It costs you nothing to find out more! You can reserve your spot now using the following link: Comprehensive Training—Get Started Immediately! No experience, no problem. This isn’t just a training—it’s a proven turnkey system that shows you how to create your own business generating car leads and start making money immediately by selling them to dealers nationwide online. Our program is designed to give you everything you need to succeed at this, right away. You don't have to be a rocket scientist and you don't need a Harvard degree. Take the bat off your shoulders and take a swing. Get out of your comfort zone, and try something totally different. Start selling car leads from home. You can even do it in your pajamas! So, What’s the Deal? We’ve cracked the code on tapping into online leads—people actively searching for cars, trucks, or SUVs within the last 48 hours. These leads aren’t random. These individuals have at least $4,000 for a down payment and live within 15-20 miles of the dealership. Best of all, you’ll have their name and phone number right at your fingertips. You can generate a remarkable 200-250 leads daily. Anything above that and you will need to consider bringing on an assistant to keep up the pace. Why This Works: Car dealers need fresh leads and that's why you’ll start by giving them 200 for free to prove their value. Even if a dealer converts just 3 of those leads into sales, they’ll be calling you for more. Why? Because each car deal brings in around $3,000 in profits, warranties, and financing. This is a no-brainer for them. How much can you make without killing yourself? Realistically, you could make over $7k to $8k in your very first month. That's just the starting point, it's possible to make $10k, $15k, $20k plus in short order. Work harder, make more money. Take your foot off the gas pedal and make less money.
